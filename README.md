# Solar Panel Investment Recommender System

This project aims to build a recommender system to suggest the best geographic locations for solar panel investments using NASA's solar radiation data. By analyzing solar radiation intensity and angle of incidence, we can identify optimal areas for solar energy generation.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Create a recommender system that suggests the best locations for solar panel investments based on solar radiation data.
- **Data**: NASA's solar radiation data, including solar radiation intensity and angle of incidence.
- **Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning, Data Science (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## Installation

To set up the environment, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
